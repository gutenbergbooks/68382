</div>

<p class="dropcap">At any time the sight of a Don Quixote leveling
an earnest lance at a mill is inspiring, hence a
book called <i>Degeneration</i>, by one Max Simon Nordau,
is worthy of attention. The book has been discussed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
pro and con as fully as it deserved. If not forgotten
it is reserved for another generation to adjudicate its
value. Enough that it has stirred up a valiant mess,
out of which can come nothing but good.</p>

<p>As a whole it is worthless—it might well have been
written by a son of Robert Elsmere and Mrs.
Nickelby—for the mosaic of clever observation is
wrought into a most grotesque picture. The perception
of Mr. Nordau is fine, but his perspective is
absurdly jumbled. The premises, logical enough,
are made to form an absurd conclusion—yet the
half-truths in the book are well worthy of note.</p>

<p>Genius was an abnormality long before Nordau
found it out from Lombroso. Granted that everybody
who has risen above the dead level of mediocrity
is a maniac, let us head the list with Jesus of
Nazareth. But does that detract from the value of
their work or the good of their mission? Moses
may have had asymmetrical ears, and Blind Homer
been possessed with all sorts of mental afflictions.
That is not the point. What Mr. Nordau does show
us is that the literature of this decade is self conscious
and that it is marked in general by a hopeless
lack of unity. Not that these facts were discovered
by the captious German: Good lack, they are
apparent enough, but he has surely emphasized
them. And the object of this is to say a say about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the present non-importance of modern literature’s
self consciousness and its lack of unity.</p>

<p>When one talks with a decrier of modernity, when
our ears are stuffed with the prattle about self consciousness,
should there be an attempt to say a word
it is met with a flaunting statement about Homer.
Homer is undeniably the great unsullied spring, the
rock struck in the desert which pours forth a clear
limpid stream. But the example does not serve. If
Homer is pristine he is also primeval. Self consciousness
in these days means nothing less than that
one comprehends in part that momentous question of
where we are at. Underlying which it means that
it has a realizing sense of battles to fight and wrongs
to retrieve. Marry and up, we might all be Homers
had literature no past. The past is a millstone that
has hung around the neck of many a sturdy man.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, there must be a certain self consciousness
nowadays if anything is to be done.
Besides, what is self consciousness? Not the kind
that mistakes the medium for the work accomplished,
but a genuine hearty self consciousness. Is it not
manifestly absurd to deny to the father of an idea the
most complete conception of his paternity? Can we
interpret the works of an author in any other proportion
than that which exists between our understanding
and his?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>But Nordau’s principal <i>casus belli</i> is the present
diversity in literature, he thinks; its lack of unity—a
segregation which denotes decay.</p>

<p>Pish!</p>

<p>Diversity is a step towards universality. And is
not the present aspect due primarily to a self
assertive spirit, a declaration of individual independence
in literature, built upon the lack of single
leaders and the abolition of a great literary center?</p>

<p>Take the literary capillarity of a great name. It
has a marvelous effect, availing perhaps for all time,
but scarcely to the succeeding generation. Dante,
Shakespeare and the world’s sons are but the flood
marks of a great literary tidal wave that crests with
eternity. These marks leave such an influence on
the next generation that they can only be viewed
with wonder. And when that same next generation
perceives that deeds were wrought on certain lines,
behold a mad rush to build on the same, to blindly
copy after the model, to servilely imitate the pattern.
This is the damning power of the so-called classicists.
Not having the original spontaneity, such
doing accomplishes little more than to emasculate
itself wittingly.</p>

<p>Trend is an unseen thread in the warp and woof
of literature. It bobs about, hides here and there,
and who will say but now and then it drops a stitch?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Yet the weave goes on for all that. Achievement in
the realm of the real and the realm of the ideal are
rarely synchronous. Literature acted as a John the
Baptist for the Renaissance. Artistic expression
antedated for centuries the march of science. Why
should we of the purple trouble ourselves if science
should now be the vanguard. It will be a close
finish at the End of Things.</p>

<p>The Sleeping Beauty is now all ready for the
magic kiss. The Prince is perhaps bending over her.
He has cut a way through the thorns, the briars and
brambles that hedged her in. He has climbed the
stairs and looks her at last squarely in the face. She
will be awake while we yet pule and despair that
there is no good in us and that if a good thing ever
came out of Nazareth it was immediately and
ignominiously pushed along by the rabble.</p>

<p>That’s a close analogue, that Sleeping Beauty.
Literature wanted not for thorns and brambles.
Conventions, artificial ties and misconceptions were of
the prickliest kind. Those that spring up where
empty ancient forms are worshipped always are, but
we have had some Princes with strong buskins, who
laughed at the stings and bade the small things do
their worst.</p>

<p>Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelites were of that kind.
Walt Whitman lacked the princely qualities, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
blue blood of prestige that would work the magic
charm, but he was valiant for all that. And there
have been others who have not lacked in bravery.</p>

<p>Now, it is just that hardihood that Nordau derides.
Let him creak and carp, let others erect their idols
and worship thereat. Even fetiches have their use.
The world wags on, however, and the line is forming
anew. We will be happy yet.</p>

<p>It is a Gargantuan task to get at the heart of this
multiple age. He will be a Titan who does it.</p>

<p>Form antedates concept. Thus far have we journeyed
on this way of ours—the leaven of concept and
of form both have broken out in patches here and
there. Let someone arise who can master both.</p>

<p>Then—</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Periodicity exists throughout all nature. Day
and night, winter and summer, equinox and
solstice; years of plenty and years of famine, commerce
active and business depressed; volcanoes in
state of eruption, then at rest; comets return, eclipses
come back, the striae of one glacial period are deepened
by those of another, and the leg o’ mutton sleeves
that our grandmammas wore in the thirties are again
upon us.</p>

<p>When the hounds start game in the mountains, the
hunter knowing that the deer moves in a circle, stands
still on the run-way, biding his time. So no one
need wail and strike his breast if his raiment is out of
style: all such should be consoled by the fact that
the fashion is surely coming back.</p>

<p>Mode in dress is only an outcrop of a general law.
Why does fashion change? Because it is the fashion.
The followers of fashion—that is to say, civilized men
and women—are not content with being all alike.
Esquimaux and Hottentots never vary their styles.
But people in the temperate zones are intemperate
and desire to excel—to be different from others—distinctive,
peculiar, individual. Very seldom is any
one strong enough to stand alone, so in certain social
circles, by common consent, all overcoats are cut one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
length—say, to come just above the knee. Then
this overcoat is gradually lowered: to the knee, just
below the knee, to the ankle—until it conceals the
feet. Then an enormous collar is added, which
when turned up and viewed from behind completely
hides the man. But this thing cannot last; it is not
many days before the same men are wearing overcoats
so short that the wearers look like matadors
ready for the fray.</p>

<p>Ladies wear hoops; the hoops expand and expand,
until the maximum of possibility in size is reached.
Something must be done! The crinoline contracts
until these same ladies appear in clinging skirts, and
the pull-back lives its little hour. Then the former
width of the dress is used to lengthen it. The skirt
touches the ground, trails two inches, six, eight, a
foot, two feet. Its length becomes too great to drag
and so is carried, to the great inconvenience of its
owner; or in banquet halls pages are employed. But
this is too much, a protest comes and two hundred
women in Boston agree to appear on the streets the
first rainy day in skirts barely coming to the boot top.
“Dress Reform” societies spring up, magazines become
the organs of the protestants and the printing
presses run over time.</p>

<p>The garb of the Quaker is only a revulsion from a
flutter of ribbons and towering headgear. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Beau Brummel lifting his hat with great flourish and
uncovering on slight excuse, we have William Penn
who uncovers to nobody; the height of Brummel’s
hat finds place in the width of Penn’s.</p>

<p>All things move in an orbit.</p>

<p>Even theories have their regular times of incubation.
They are hatched, grow lusty, crow in falsetto
or else cackle; then they proceed to scratch in the
flower beds of conservatism to the hysterical fear of
good old ladies, who shoo them away. Or if the
damage seems serious, the ladies set dogs—the lap-dogs
of war—upon them.</p>

<p>“The sun do move;” Brother Jasper is right.
All things move. And when matters get pushed to a
point where they fall on t’other side, a Reformer appears.
The people proclaim him king, but he modestly
calls himself “Protector.” He is spoken of in
history as the Savior of the State.</p>

<p>There are only two classes of men who live in history:
those who crowd a thing to its extreme limit,
and those who then arise and cry “Hold!” A
Pharaoh makes a Moses possible. The latter we
write down in our books as immortal, the first as infamous.</p>

<p>This is true of all who live in history, whether in
the realm of politics, religion or art. History is only
a record of ideas (or lack of them) pushed to a point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
where revulsion occurs. If Rome had been moderate,
Luther would have had no excuse.</p>

<p>Literature obeys the law; its orbit is an ellipse.
The illustrious names in letters are those of the men
who have stood at aphelion or perihelion and waved
the flaring comet back.</p>

<p>The so-called great poets are the men stationed by
fate at these pivotal points. And as fires burn brightest
when the wind is high, so these men facing mob
majorities have, through opposition, had their intellects
fanned into a flame.</p>

<p>More than thirteen decisive battles have taken
place in the world of letters. And the question at
issue has always been the same: Radical and Conservative
calling themselves Realist, Romanticist,
Veritist or What-not struggling for supremacy.</p>

<p>Term it “Veritism” and “Impressionism” if you
prefer—juggle the names and put your Union troops
in gray, but this does not change the question.</p>

<p>The battle between the two schools of literature is
a football game. The extreme goal on one side is
tea table chatter, on the other an obscure symbolism.
“The difference is this:” said Dion Boucicault,
“when Romanticism goes to seed it is ‘rot;’ when
Realism reaches a like condition it is only ‘drivel.’”</p>

<p>In literary production why should we hear so much
about the dignity of this school and the propriety of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
that. Men who fail to appreciate the individual excellence
of a certain literary output, declare it to be
without sense and therefore base. In letters they assume
that a style is wholly good or it is wholly bad.
They make no allowances for temperament; they
would have all men speak in one voice.</p>

<p>Yet liberty need not result in disorder, nor can originality
serve as a pretext for boozy inaccuracy. In
a literary production the bolder the conception the
more irreproachable should be the execution.</p>

<p>There is a tendency for thought to get fixed in set
forms, and this form is always that which has been
used by some great man. For any one to express
thought and feeling in a different way is blasphemy to
the eunuchs who guard the tents of Tradition.</p>

<p>Writers of different schools exist because their style
fits the mind of a certain style of reader. The sprightly,
animated picturesqueness, the play of wit and flights
of imagination are only a full expression of what many
faintly feel. Thus their mood is mirrored and their
thought expressed: hence they are pleased.</p>

<p>In fact the only reason why we like a writer is because
he expresses our thought in a way we like.
And the reason we dislike a writer is because he deals
in that which is not ours. We of course might grow
to like him, but the process is slow, for according to
Herbert Spencer we must hear a thing six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
times before we understand. If we comprehend a
proposition at once, it is only because it was ours already.
If the portrayal of a situation in fiction fascinates
us, it is because we (in fancy or fact) have
gone before and spied out the land.</p>

<p>There must be more than one school of literature,
because there is more than one mood of mind: just
as in religion there must be many sects. We worship
God not only in sincerity and truth, but according to
the temperament our mothers gave us.</p>

<p>The emotional “school of religion” finds its votaries
in Methodism: Methodism fits a certain mind.
The stately dignity of the Ritualist is a necessity to
a certain cast of intellect. And until we get a church
that is broad enough, and deep enough, and high
enough to allow for temperament in men, “church
union” will exist only as an abstract idea.</p>

<p>Until we have a school of literature that will combine
all schools and give the liberty to a full expression
of every mood, there will be a warfare between
the “sects” that give free rein to imagination and
the sect that, having no imagination, merely describes.
When one school driven by the jibes and jeers of the
other tilts to t’other side, a heavy man will start the
teeter back, and he is the man we crown.</p>

<p>And let us ever crown the heavy man when we
find him.</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Before George Du Maurier created the one
complaisant female who is admitted into all
the good society of Europe and America he achieved
some fame as the author of a recipe for keeping
peace in families. The good wife was to apply the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
prescription, and it read “Feed the Brute.”
Whether this meant to keep a good cook or to cater
to the element in human nature which the paradox
of civilization constantly brings into abnormal prominence
among the overwrought people Mr. Du
Maurier describes, is not clear. The man as a whole
or his grosser nature may be the brute referred to.
But the policy of feeding the unidentified fauna of
Mr. Du Maurier’s world is in no doubt. Modern
custom has settled the most direct road to satisfaction
of the men and women who compose society. You
may see its sign boards at any formal social meeting,
and they all point to the dining room.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> said some time ago that
hospitality had become an exchange he meant an
exchange of food. There is no plainer way to state
the fact—short of nausea. Of course hospitality does
not start at eating. That is where it ends. The
starting point is the purest courtesy—the <i>caritas</i> that
“seeketh not her own,” “is not puffed up” and
“abideth” as the head of the trinity of eternal
virtues. But on the most generous of virtues grows
the most selfish of vices, and ostentation is the
death-dealing parasite that destroys primitive
hospitality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moor Gage lives in the suburbs. It is the
proper place to live—if you can. She has neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and likes them. She calls, swaps cards with the
ladies, imbibes a little hot water, and then gets
along where her social position requires somebody
should be fed. She is just as good as Mrs. Taxsale
on the other avenue, so hospitality alone won’t fill
the bill. A caterer must mince this dinner. Mr.
Moor Gage must perspire later on, but now is feeding
time. At much expense the food is arranged
for. At more expense virgin dresses must be gotten
together, if all hands stitch and try on till the hour
the dinner comes. When they are gone, feeders and
fed draw one breath of content. “It’s all over.”</p>

<p>Or, is it a reception. The hospitality is all in the
front of the house. That’s where the receiving
party are. But the procession doesn’t linger there.
It moves rearward. The animals are to be fed. If
one doubts the sincerity of this movement let him
recall the comments of those who “couldn’t get to
the dining room” at the last distribution of eatables.</p>

<p>Of course when Mrs. Taxsale opens her larder to
her friends she will have a little better “stuff”—they
really do call it by that name in competent
society—and so the auction goes on. Sometimes
card parties and other social efforts not primarily
connected with digestion get mixed up with catering.
The result is usually disastrous. Bidding gets too
high for some of the members. The bargain day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
pace is too fast. There ends the card club.</p>

<p>There are persons, here and there, who think
there is something finer than feeding in courtesy.
They are Philistines. They object to materialism,
even when it swamps only the things of this world.
It is also reported, on somewhat vague evidence,
that refined literary people are not so given to feeding
as the common folks of Mr. Du Maurier’s world.
It is to bear a suggestion to these that this is
written. Literary persons being functionally the
makers of custom have a great glory within easy
reach. Let them crystallize their scattered atoms of
protest in an Anti Free Lunch League. It may take
some self denial, but there is the compensating
pleasure of mutual admiration when they gather at a
call like this:</p>

<div class="boxdots">

<p><i>Miss Basbleu will be pleased to welcome
you at her residence</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tuesday evening</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>to meet Mr. Patemback.</i></p>

<p><i>Nordau at 11.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Contemplation of the infinite fall will take the
place of supper in a most edifying way. It is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
presumed that literary people have had something
to eat at home.</p>

<p>The segregation of society thus begun will leave
the materialists who compose its majority to follow
out their instincts, and it will be reasonable to look
for a vast improvement in eating entertainments in
consequence. Mrs. Moor Gage and Mrs. Taxsale
will then be freer to advertise their attractions—as
thus:</p>

<div class="boxdots">

<p><i>Your company is requested on</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Wednesday evening</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>at the residence of Mrs. Moor Gage,</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Five Per Cent Avenue,</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Syndicate Park.</i></p>

<p><i>H. L. at 11.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“H. L.” means hot lunch, which may be varied
indefinitely. It is plainly a great improvement on
“Dancing at 9.” You get dancing everywhere.
Specifications may be introduced. For those who
don’t like bread pencils and ice cream shingles something
more solid may be put on the bill of fare, which
will in time serve as the invitation also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>The suggestion is made in the interest of sincerer
living. If we are to “feed the brute,” why not say
so?</p>

<p class="dropcap">The taste for literature in homeopathic doses
seems to be growing. If this thing keeps on, the
time may come when knowledge will be put up like
pills or wafers or tablets. And a great convenience
it would be to the busy sons of American toil. If
one wished to prepare an article on some historical
subject, for instance, he could buy a box of Motley’s
American Pills or Gibbon’s Roman Tablets, and take
one after another until the requisite amount of historical
information were absorbed. It would also be
pleasant, if a gentle titillation of the literary senses
were desired, to buy a few Richard Harding Davis
wafers and lie down to delightful dreams. Or in
case one’s conscience became unusually obstreperous,
he could take Biblical tabules till his system was
soaked with sanctity. If one’s pessimism were temporarily
upmost, he could find plenty of Nordau’s
pillules to help him enjoy his misery while the fit
lasted. It’s a great scheme. Methinks the dim distant
future holds a publisher’s announcement similar
to this:</p>

In gilt edge boxes, uncut, $2.00 per box. By all

<p class="center allsmcap">A FEW CRITICISMS.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Washington Roast</i>: “Not a dull pill in the box.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>New York Rostrum</i>: “Very clever. After taking
one pill, the reader cannot put down the box until
he has taken all its contents.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Chicago Between-Seas</i>: “Cannot contain our disgust.
Tried to digest the contents of these boxes,
but threw up the job after taking one pill.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>New Orleans Pickatune</i>: “The pills lead gently and
pleasantly up to the final mystery when the Fit
clears everything up in a very sensational manner.
More such pills would have a highly beneficial effect
upon modern literature.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">It is only during inclement weather that writers
who cannot command the oracular and prophetic
freedom, which is the proud possession of the
morning and evening journals, can hope to gain
even the smallest audience; for the masses are
more hungry for facts which lie, than for the truth,
or even those fine fantasies that afford us some surcease
of wide-open eyed sorrow. If this paper is
ever read at all, it should be read in gloomy weather.
Indeed, it is intended to be read on a gray day, as it
was written on a wild night. Only very robust
imaginations feel the fascination or the eternal questions
of life and death in the wide ample world of
broad, white sunlight; for their animal spirits get
the better of their reason. In rainy weather we
writers flatten our noses against the panes of strange
windows, lost to all sense of propriety, in the wild
hope that some one within is reading one of our
amusing works. In the case of the present writer,
however, it is all proper to say that he has suffered
disillusionment so often that he has espoused a chill
dignity, and sits at home and reads his own works
in a spirit of grim appreciation. Indeed, accepting
the appalling vacuity of the million noisy heads as an
incurable fact—a fact that should chasten the vanity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of those whose hopes and ambitions and thought
are borne and blown hither and thither, like puff-balls
upon the acclaiming wind of ten thousand
pairs of lungs—it may be said with perfect propriety
that it is nothing less than impertinence for any writer,
who aims to rise above the biting lechery of the common
imaginations, to expect to find readers under
clear skies. Even the midsummer sun, which is
surely innocent of any such evil intention, seems to
only ripen distracting noises in the minds of the
vast majority sunk in the turgid mean of commonplace;
for how many good souls can be bothered
with anything more abstract than the very latest
soggy novel, just hot and dirty from the press, in
sunshiny weather? Even moonshine is wasted upon
all but those feather-brains on the lookout for ghosts.</p>

<p>And it may be noted, although it is not strictly relevant,
that, with the multiplication of periodicals of
one sort and another, even stormy weather is beginning
to fail the few writers in our day who are
audacious enough to still cling to the old ambitions
of letters, in spite of worldly prudence and all the
warnings of the literary tip-staffs who infallibly know
“the market”—for in the periodical world it is
raining hot-baked sensations and novelties every
hour in the twenty-four—the depressing vulgar commonplaces
that have made up the round of human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
existence from the dawn of history and always will.
But we must make up our minds to accept this as one
of the small ironies of life: thought is smothered in an
immense spawn of crocodile words. The newspapers
we have always with us; and they succeed in making
such an unceasing and damnable din that only an
insignificant minority of exceptionally cool heads
can hear themselves think.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the printing press has
contributed in no small degree toward driving the
Devil out of orthodox theology. This is a fact,
although Atheists, Rationalists and Materialists claim
the credit of it. Indeed, His Eminence confessed to
me, over a bottle of Lachryma Christi at the Theological
Club, that he was completely discouraged, and
he announced that he was revolving in his mind the
expediency of abandoning the long and honorable
career, which he has enjoyed in the polity of human
life. He said that he had found his old-fashioned
and painstaking tortuous methods of depraving men’s
minds suddenly rendered absolutely puerile, ridiculous
and contemptible by comparison with the
unwearied and stupendous operations of the steam-presses
of journalism. The meeting depressed me
greatly; for whatever opinions other folk may profess
to hold of the Devil, the more sober imaginations,
the humorous writers, will always be glad to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
testify to the ungrudged and inestimable services he
has continually rendered them in their arduous and
ill-paid calling. I have since learned definitely that
the Devil was in good earnest, and has retired into
a voluntary exile, whence endless deputations of
learned, suppliant, apologetic and furious theologians
have endeavored to coax him, but entirely in vain.
He has abdicated, he replies steadfastly, forever;
and the desperate situation of the theologians, whose
calling and character is seriously imperiled by his
obstinacy, leaves him perfectly unmoved. He declares
he has been long abandoned by those who
flourished upon the pleasantries which he devised to
make life amusing, and being under no sort of moral
obligation to ingrates who have publicly held his
name and character in abhorrence, he cheerfully
abandons them to their wretched fate. He himself
is humbled; let them taste of his bitterness, as they
have shared in his prosperity, without any honest
acknowledgment of his benefaction. He is still
great enough to preserve his dignity; let them preserve
their own as best they can. And this ought
not to be a difficult business; for there are still a
multitude of fools in the world, and any new noisy
dogma is not more than twenty-four hours old before
a million credulous heads believe it embodies the immanent
truth of the universe. Such subtle wits as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
theologians, and those whom they serve, can assuredly
find a way out of the mire of misfortune, as the
multitude is always hospitable to miracle workers,
though deaf and blind to facts and truth.</p>

<p>The Devil himself, however, has discovered the
ironies of the ambition that can only prosper upon
the folly of fools. He recognizes the omnipotence
of his rivals, the omniscient journalists, in this vineyard,
and is content to let them discover in due time
that wisdom does not consist in the counting of
noses, and that mere bawdy optimism brings its own
dissatisfaction. And, moreover, in retiring, the
Devil is sustained by the firm conviction that his old
laborious schemes for the befuddlement and bewilderment
and corruption of mankind will not only be
ably continued, but improved and surpassed in subtlety
and thoroughness by these audacious and
unscrupulous successors. So his decision is irrevocable;
he has abdicated forever. Emulation would
but emphasize the futile and ludicrous pretensions of
his old ingrate protegees, the theologians; and the
Devil is not ungenerous, even in misfortune, even to
those base hypocrites who have enjoyed his protection
and reviled him. Then, retirement with dignity
is better than embittered ambition and a fall without
dignity. As he points out—and those who have
known him in better days should assuredly sustain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
him in his noble and philosophic humility, so rare
among the great of fallen fortunes—it is worse than
useless for him to labor painfully to cultivate a deep
and stirring delight in original sin in one promising
little urchin, spending weary days and anxious and
tender solicitude on the hard benches of the public
schools, when the great and omniscient newspaper
press can at any given moment set a whole nation,
or even the whole civilized world, crawling upon all
fours, nosing and wallowing in filth. Only a few
aboriginal tribes escape, and the Devil does not deem
these worthy of cultivation, since civilization is
encroaching upon them and their days are already
numbered.</p>

<p>The Devil was always notoriously an abandoned
pessimist, and his dismal view of the outcome
of the great modern passion for literacy is
probably due to disappointed ambition and malevolence;
for, granting all the suffocating triviality and
vulgarity of the Sabbatical literature dished up in
the seventh day’s newspapers, it must always in strict
justice be remembered that long and beautiful abstracts
of sermons of soporific platitude, and charmingly
convincing illogic, appear regularly in the
Monday morning issues. And so optimists may feel
that the morals of civilization are safe.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, evil tongues cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
silenced. If the accumulation of facts were not such a
patently depraved, atrabilious and libellous business,
there would be fewer cynics, and cheerful, good natured
optimism would expire for want of that venomous opposition
which contracts hopeless stupidity into stony
and barren virtue. Epigrams would become dissipated
in the most undivided passion for truth, in order to
diffuse it again into commonness among eager and
hungry ears; but the fact is, these ears are now
enamored of such noises as cost them no sort of
intellectual effort.</p>

<p>It may as well be stated here that the Devil has
somehow lost a great deal of his popularity in the
congregations of the elect, through the continual
assaults of Philistines and the unfortunate discovery
of natural facts, that have taken catastrophe out of
the Devil’s hands and transferred it to the domain of
inflexible and insensible law. But the moral cowardice
revealed in this abandonment of the Devil is
certainly pathetic. Yet we must remember that it is
ever so—for the people who turn on us first are the
ones we have most benefited. And this seems to be
one of Nature’s devices for diverting our energies
into new channels of well doing.</p>

<p>I have seen the tribulation that God has given to
the sons of men; yet He has made everything beautiful
in its time: and I know that there is no good
but for a man to rejoice and to do the good that he
can in life: and I would have every man eat and
drink and enjoy the fruit of his labor, for this is the
gift of God.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Our neighboring city of Buffalo is to be congratulated.
The International League of Press Clubs will
convene there next summer. A plumber who was
accidentally blackballed by the Buffalo club writes
me that they will come “some in rags and some in
jags.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> If the women who wheel did but know it they
would undoubtedly be influenced by the fact, patent
to all men, that all the compromise garments for
bicycle wear are hideous. There is no beauty in and
of any of them. The more cut off they are the
worse. There is only one element of grace about
drapery, and that is in its flowing lines. The cut-off
Russian blouses are no lovelier than a high hat or a
hydrant cover. By and by, when Philistine good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
sense shall have won dominion over the ladies who
bike, it will be discovered by them that there is no
essential impurity in dress. The woman who does
masculine things should wear masculine covering.
Why not? Is it to be assumed that the pedal
branches of the human form divine are by any
natural law under ban? Or is it custom that makes
the difference? If so, it will be deemed indecent
one of these days to drape the arms, now hidden in
balloons, in the tight sleeves of our elder sisters.</p>

<p>It may be guessed at a venture, there being no
authority except that nebulous tyranny that controls
all matters of feminine custom, that the difficulty
would be met in some measure if the fair wheelers
did not have to get off the machine in public view.
Even a man is apt to be embarrassed when he walks
the pavement with a clamp around his nether
drapery, both looking and feeling as if he had been
through burdocks and come away loaded. It is of
easy recollection how one feels on the board walk
with clinging garments that were all right in the
water a moment ago. The ladies might be willing
to wear knickerbockers—and they ought to be told
that in nothing else would they look so well—if by
some contrivance a fall of drapery sheltered the too-freely
evidenced pedestals of beauty when off the
wheel. What Felix will invent such a curtain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
a way of keeping it out of the way when not wanted?
Here is an opening for genius—and a beneficent one,
for by such devices is civilization advanced.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mrs. Frank Guesslie has written an article on <i>How
My Husbands Proposed</i>. It will be syndicated by the
National Thought Supply and Newspaper Feeding
Company.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A newspaper that does much show printing announces
in big headlines: “A Woman Clown. The
Only One Is With Barnum and Bailey.” Barnum
and Bailey reside in different climates just now. That
“only” woman clown must be as ubiquitous as Sydney
Smith’s Scot.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The Boston Woman’s Rescue League has the
champion non sequitur. The league is against bicycling
by women, and announces the startling discovery
that “thirty per cent of the girls that have
come to the Rescue League for aid were bicycle riders
at one time.” Probably one hundred per cent of the
same were innocent girls at one time. Maybe it was
when they biked.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I understand there’s a movement in the Back Bay
gravel pit of Boston, Mass., to abolish the word
“Mr.” on calling cards. Some of the three-named
have been a little crowded for space, perhaps, or it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
may be that they dimly realize that it isn’t good taste
to call oneself by a complimentary title. Some clergymen
refuse to sign “Rev.” before their names, or
put it in parenthesis as if to have it beyond their personal
reach, as New England ladies write “(Miss)”
and others “(Mrs.)”. Good Philistines need not
be told that Mr. means Master and is a compliment
in the second person. It is of a piece with lifting
the hat, theoretically a helmet, to the person whom
you respect. That was the old time vote of confidence.
You thus expressed the belief that he
wouldn’t brain you with a broadsword at the first opportunity.
Giving the hand was another token of
disarmament as a mark of confidence. Bowing the
head also invited the knightly salute with any convenient
weapon. With this went a more or less sincere
confession of his imputed power. You called
him “master,” which became “mister” by corruption.
Our imitative good society has forgotten
the meaning of the thing it imitates, as usual. Our
ready-made coats of arms seldom fit. He that is
greatest calls himself servant, according to good authority,
and not master. Even Beacon Hill and the
adjacent desert seems to have come to a realization of
the fact. We may look for the cards of John De
Smythe Smythe or Perkins Hopkinson Revere with
Mr. in brackets or omitted one of these days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> “Mamma,” said seven-year-old, in the suburbs,
“when will somebody’s house or somebody’s barn
burn up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said mamma, “I hope never.
But I suppose they will sometime.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the son, with a sigh, “it’s an awful
long time since we had a good fire.”</p>

<p>Thus we see that even calamity may furnish entertainment
for the simple and sincere.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Rock &amp; Bumball, of Chicago, announce a new
volume by Gallbert Faker. Its title is <i>Scenes in the
Boshy Hills</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Several mighty and high church bishops in this
country are out against “the new woman.” It is
noted that they don’t say anything against “the old
woman” in general or in particular.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>How to Carry a Cat in a Basket</i> is the attractive
title of an article to appear in the forthcoming
<i>Ladies’ Fireside Fudge</i>, from the pen of its gifted
editor, Mr. E. W. Sok.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> There are things in these maxnordo days that are
enough to make a man strike his father—for something
besides a loan. For instance, a few weeks
since we had the peculiar spectacle of the Marquis of
Queensbury being done up by his son according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
London rules; and now in the last issue of the <i>Chip-Munk</i>
we see “A Recent Writer in <i>Scribner’s</i>” well
cuffed by a boy of whom he is the author.
“How sharper than a serpent’s tooth,” etc.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Judge Tourgee is still making straw without bricks
in the <i>Basis</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Now that Mrs. Cady Stanton has launched her
Woman’s Bible, let her prepare to enter a woman’s
heaven. The men won’t be in it.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Robert Grant is getting democratic. He is down
as far as the summer girl in the current <i>Scribner</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>The Napoleon on the Hearth</i> is a new magazine
announced from New York. It will bear the subtitle,
<i>Every Man His Own Bonaparte Revival</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A new book by Mr. Poultry Bigead is about
ready. It will be called <i>My Collection of Stones
from Cherries Eaten by the German Emperor</i>, and
will contain a frontispiece of <i>Cavalry Horses Having
Spasms</i>, by a well known artist.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> On what ought to be very good authority I am told
that if the women who wheel adopt knickerbockers,
there will be more care of the female infants of the
next generation. Some of the ladies who most
strongly object to the advanced and advancing style<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
are said to have good reasons in the matter of physical
conformation. I know parents who are very
careful not to let their boy babies stand alone too
early, fearing bow legs. Perhaps the parents of the
future will be equally careful about their girlies, in
view of the changing fashion in nether drapery.</p>

<p>Apropos of this, I know a very pleasant little lady—pleasant,
but thin—whose brother is a sad wag.
“Adelaide,” he said to her last Tuesday, “if you
wear those new knickerbockers of yours out on the
street, you’ll get yourself arrested for having no visible
means of support.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is asserted that Mr. George A. Hibbard is perfectly
serious.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is really too bad that a magazine which lives up
to its standard so well as the <i>Overland Monthly</i>
should try to make us believe that its illustrations are
much better than those in Frank Leslie’s <i>Budget</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>How I Wrote the Account of How I Wrote My
First Book</i>, by General Louisa Wallace, author of
<i>Bob Hur</i>, is announced.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I have received through Messrs. Funk &amp; Wagnalls,
publishers of a Methodist dictionary and other works
of erudition and vital piety, an invitation to vote aye
on a large number of changes of words in common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
use—mostly in the fonetic direction. Simplicity is
the apparent aim. There is a good deal of retrospect
in the list. Some of the spellings that were licked
out of us when we were boys seem like old friends
come back to ask our pardon. The old days are
with us when we are told to spell “skul,” for
example. The evisceration of sacred words is a
little arbitrary. “Savior” is spelt without the full-mouthed
British “u,” dear to every lover of the Prayer
Book, but Antichrist isn’t economized at all.
“Pel-mel” looks it, if a word ever did. “Graf” is
something to be guessed at, and one may ask if
“adulterin” is something to eat. The fonetix
didn’t reach Czar, or perhaps our M. E.—me friends
are respecters of persons. However, they shortened
“pontiff” by an “f,” and I wouldn’t be surprised if
His Holiness masqueraded as “Pop” in the next
circular. It is interesting, if not impressive, this
reform—like the abbreviation of bicycle clothes and
the sending of bad writing by wire.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> That choking female on the cover of the <i>Mid-Continent</i>
is still tottering, but hasn’t tumbled yet.
Neither have the publishers, it would seem.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A hammock and a book and a horse and a yacht
are really enough to begin with for Robert Grant.
He says as much in <i>Scribner’s</i> and he doesn’t care a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
dam for Newport for a week or two. How little the
things of this vain world appeal to those who can
have them by touching a button.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It runs in the Howl family. W. Dean has a daughter
who puts her poems under display ad heads in
<i>Scribner’s</i>. The decorative head is the thing. The
poem just belongs.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The last <i>Century</i> is not so distinctly medieval as
some of its predecessors.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mrs. Robert Humphrey Elsmere Ward has quit
twaddling for a space. “Bessie Costrell” is ended,
and it’s a toss up between jubilate and nunc dimittis.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The current <i>Atlantic</i> is very pacific—not to say
mild.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The June <i>Chautauquan</i> really praises “newspaper
English.” This is the time of year when the Reservation
wants all the newspaper English it can get for
nothing.</p>

<p>The amazing thing about that Amazing Marriage is
the lot of talk the proof reader has read about it.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Tarbell discovered Napoleon, but McClure discovered
Tarbell. Now let’s have a series of living documents—“Tarbell
at 8,” “Tarbell at 9:30,” “Tarbell
at 46,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The World, the Flesh and the Devil have gone
out of partnership in the ’Frisco <i>News-Letter</i>. The
head of the firm retires.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/deco4.jpg" width="45" height="30" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Meditations in Motley” reveals a new
American essayist, honest and whimsical, with a
good deal of decorative plain speaking. An
occasional carelessness of style is redeemed by
unfailing insight.—<span class="smcap">I. Zangwill</span> in <i>The Pall Mall
Magazine</i> for April, 1895.</p>

<p>A series of well written essays, remarkable on
the whole for observation, refinement of feeling
and literary sense. The book may be taken as a
wholesome protest against the utilitarian efforts
of the Time-Spirit, and as a plea for the rights
and liberties of the imagination. We congratulate
Mr. Harte on the success of his book.—<i>Public
Opinion</i>, London, England.</p>

<p>Mr. Harte is not always so good in the piece as
in the pattern, but he is often a pleasant companion,
and I have met with no volume of essays
from America since Miss Agnes Repplier’s so
good as his “Meditations in Motley.”—<span class="smcap">Richard
